git pull ( dont need directory)

git add ( filename with extension)
git commit ( add some commentsw on what I've done)
git push 

# To check what files you need to commit or what you have changed
git status

# To check the most recent commits you can use
git log

Also! I think your console dumps you into a vim session for your commit
messages. So you can either circumvent this by typing 

git commit -m "Your commit message"

Or you can just use the vim session by typing 'i' to enter insert mode,
type your commit message, press escape, then type ':wq'; where the 'w'
stands for 'write' and the 'q' stands for quit.
